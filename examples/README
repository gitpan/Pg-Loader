 This is a collection of sample configuration and data files to
serve as examples for how configuration files should look. 
Some entries are not yet supported by pgloader.pl, so please
consult the USAGE file or the pod inside pgloader.pl for
what features are actually implemented. Un-implemented entries 
are silently ignored.
