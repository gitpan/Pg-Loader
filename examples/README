 This is a collection of sample configuration and data files; and
serve as example of how the configuration files should look. 
Some entries are not yet supported by pgloader.pl, so please
consult the USAGE file, or the pod inside pgloader.pl to read
what features are actually implemented. Un-implemented entries 
are silently ignored.
