<title>Simple COPY</title>
<body>
A quick intro for the impatient. 
Perhaps a simple example is all you need to get things done.
<p>
Suppose this was the definition
<a href="definition.txt">definition</a> 
of your table and want to load data to it.
For this example, we assume data are already validated -
-- pre-validation is a central concept in bulk loading.

<p><b> Present State </b><p>
Here is what was already in the exam table.
<pre>
=> select * from exam ;
    fn     |   ln   | exam | score
-----------+--------+------+-------
 tambouras | vena   |    4 |    97
 sun       | ugjn   |    6 |    82

</pre>

<b>The Task</b><p>
Suppose we need to load new data and erase old data.

<p>
<b>SOLUTION</b></p>
<OL>
<LI> File exam.csv contains our pre-validate  new data in 
<a href="exam_csv.txt">csv format.</a> 
<LI>Now, Write a 
<a href="pgloader.conf">pgloader.conf</a> configuration file. Done.
</OL>
